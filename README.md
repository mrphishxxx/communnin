Communnin
================
This app is being developed to house [Huginn](https://github.com/cantino/huginn) scenarios.

The ideal flow will be that:
- Bob exports a scenario he'd like to share from his instance of Huginn.
- Bob logs into Communnin, and uploads his scenario JSON file
- Jane visits Communnin looking for a scenario to help her solve a problem using Twitter
- Jane browses the scenarios that involve Twitter and finds Bob's scenario
- Jane imports Bob's scenario into her own Huginn instance using the URL from Communnin
